    What operating system do you use? Are you a PC or Mac from days long past? Do you commit to Android or iOS over the other? Perhaps you have some favorite alternative choice like BSD, Linux, etc. Does your terminal have all the customizations available? These things are minor preferences to people that focus on productivity. Don't focus on the OS or the terminal, focus on how to be effective regardless of those things. Don't tie your worth or abilities to a technology or solution but to the skills, techniques, and tooling that promotes interdependence.
